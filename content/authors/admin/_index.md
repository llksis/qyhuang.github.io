Qianyi (Ada) HUANG is a researcher at the intersection of communication, technology, and society. Her research explores how emerging digital technologies‚Äîfrom social media to AI‚Äîshape human psychology, social interactions, and public discourse.

She is particularly interested in topics such as computational communication, political persuasion, health communication, and the nuanced effects of digital media on individual well-being. Methodologically, she employs a mixed-methods approach, combining computational techniques (e.g., natural language processing, network analysis) with established social scientific methods.

Her interdisciplinary perspective is grounded in her unique academic training, which includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Master's-level studies in Communication. She is currently a Master of Arts candidate at the City University of Hong Kong.
